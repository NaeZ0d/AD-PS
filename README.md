<h1>Active Directory Home Lab w/ PowerShell</h1>

 
<h2>Description</h2>
We are going to walk through how to create an Active Directory lab environment using Virtual Box. In this lab, Windows 10 Pro ISO and Windows Server 2016 ISO will be downloaded and configured as separate virtual machines in Virtual Box. This lab will definitely help you develop an understanding of how Active Directory works, how to set up a virtual machine, and how Windows networking works. I'd highly recommend running through this lab several times to solidify your knowledge on the matter and create a strong foundation in virtualization. Please let me know if you have any questions!
